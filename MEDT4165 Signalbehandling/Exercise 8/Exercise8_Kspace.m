part 1
note: When i say in K-space, i mean the psf in the k-space.

(i)By reducing the bandwidth we increase the pulslength. If we reduce the
bandwidth, then we reduce the frequency components in the K-space. And when
we have have less frequency components and take the inverse fourier and get
to the spatial dimension, we get a larger point in the radial dir and the
point is more smeared out. The point spread function gets worse or smeared
out.

(ii)When we increase the bandwidth we decrease the the pulslength. In this case
we get more frequency components in K-space, which in spatial dimension
gives more compressed/smaller point spread function in radial
diretion(depth). 

Part 2
(i) By reducing the centerfrequency we reduce the frequency components in
the K-space. We reduce the axial and radial components in the K-space. So
when we take the inverse fourier of the k-space we get more wider point
spread function, this is because the we get wider lobe of the sinc function
in the spatial dimension, due to smaller width in K-space of the beam.
(ii) By increasing the centerfrequency, we increase the frequency
component. Since we have the same angle for the beam pattern, and move
further down the radial diretion, we get a larger width/more frequency
components in the radial dirvetion. This give more narrow point spread
function in the spatial domain. This also increases the pulse frequency
response.

Part 3
(i)By reducing the f-number the frequency response increases, gets wider. 
Recalling that the F#=F/D. And since the focus point is constant, we only
vary the aperture. By reducing the F-number, we increase the aperture.
Meaning that we use more elements to image the object. We thus get a more
narros beam, which yields a larger width in the K-space in the lateral
direction. Which in spatial domain yields a smaller/compressed point in the
lateral direction. We can also see this concept from another point of view:
The point spread function is the aperture frequency response * pulse
frequency response.
(ii) The opposite happens when we increase the F-number, the frequency
response gets smaller, narrow in the lateral dir. But the pulse frequency
response is constant. In this case we use less elements on the transducer,
which gives a wider lobe at the focus, which smeares out the object in the
spatial domain.

Part 4
By reducing the gain to 18, and the transmitting and recieving aperture to
1. The ultrasound image looks like my object image. As one can see; the
horizontal like is quite easy to see and has alot of energy in the
ultrasound image. This is due to the fact that nearly all the energy from
the transducer is reflected to the transducer. While for the vertical line,
we only observe som dots, this has the same reason; the energy from the
transducer is not reflected to the transducer, only som small parts which
are the dots in the ultrasound image. One can improve the ultrasound image
by reducing the F-number. This increases the elements(when the lenght to
focus is constant) used in the beam which improves the lateral resolution.
